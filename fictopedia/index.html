Survivor 0948, [07.02.2026 23:08]
It was a hot August day in Focsani, when the sun seemed to have melted the asphalt on Strada Viorelelor in the Obrejita neighborhood. The air was heavy, full of the smell of dust and dried flowers, and no one imagined that that oppressive silence was about to be broken by an unprecedented nightmare.
Mihai Caradan was twelve years old. A silent boy, with eyes that seemed much older than his age. Neighbors described him as a lonely child, who would sit for hours on the steps of house number 610, staring blankly at the world around him. He had no friends, he didn't play football with the other kids. He lost himself in video games and in universes he created, where control was absolute. In the real world, however, he felt invisible and powerless. In his mind, the war had begun long ago. Now, it was time to bring him back to reality.
That morning, after his parents had left for work, thinking their son was at school for a summer course, Mihai entered the garage. His father, a former police officer, kept a collection of weapons there that he considered secure. For Mihai, security had been an illusion. With the patience of an adult, he selected a Gali AR tactical rifle, a UMP 45 submachine gun, and, from a hidden drawer, several sachets of C4 plastic explosive. He loaded them into a school backpack, along with several magazines of ammunition. There was nothing to read on his face. Only a terrifying calm.
The first gunshot rang out around noon. It was a dry shot, cutting through the bruit of the day. Then came an explosion of noise and fury. Mihai came out of the garage and opened fire on the first neighbors who came out to the yard, then on those who ran to see what was happening. He fired methodically, without screaming, without howling, only with a cold clink of the mechanism each time he reloaded. The Gali AR bit the air with demonic precision, and the bullets shattered windows, fences and lives.
Panic gripped the neighborhood. People were hiding under houses, in basements, trying to call their relatives, but the lines were overloaded. Mihai moved along Strada Viorelelor like a hunter in his own hunting ground. He entered the yards, broke down doors and continued the massacre. When he felt the police approaching, he placed the C4 charges at the gates of some houses and under the windows of a small block at the end of the street. Subsequent explosions blew away roofs and sent metal shrapnel flying through the air, shredding everything around.
When the special forces entered the neighborhood, they found an apocalyptic landscape. Viorelelor Street was a hive of flames, smoke, and blood. Seventeen bodies lay on the sidewalks and in the yards—old people, women, children. Eighty-nine more people, with injuries ranging from scratches to catastrophic trauma, lay on the ground, screaming or moaning, waiting for the ambulances that couldn’t yet enter the area.
Mihai Caradan stopped in front of his house, number 610. The building was untouched, an island of normality amidst the chaos he had created. He let the weapons fall from his hands onto the hot asphalt. He looked one last time at the smoke rising from the neighborhood, at the sirens that were almost deafening. Then, he pulled out a pistol he had kept at his back and, without the slightest hesitation, pointed the gun at his own head. A final shot ended the horror. His small body fell to the ground right at the gate of the house, next to his mother’s petunias.
In the days that followed, Strada Viorelelor became a silent, haunted place. Journalists, psychologists and analysts tried to find a meaning, a reason. They talked about violent video games, about isolation, about access to weapons. But no one could ever fully explain how a twelve-year-old could turn a quiet street into a tomb and how a name like Mihai Caradan came to be spoken with the same horror as that of much bigger monsters. For those in Focșani, and especially for the survivors of Strada Viorelelor, the wound remained open, a constant reminder that the monster does not always wear an adult face. Sometimes it bears the face of a child next door. 1 million people were injured due to the fire
